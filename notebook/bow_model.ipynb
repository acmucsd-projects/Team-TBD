I am interested in exploring more about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Currently, I am trying to build a more solid mathematical foundation for ML through coursework, so I can gain more maturity to understand ML concepts in depth. Meanwhile, I am building my technical skills to train ML/DL models by self-learning and hopefully my skillset could grow to a level where I can build meaningful ML projects and work in a ML lab. After a general introduction to ML during my visit at UC Berkeley, I am particularly drawn to problems related to Computer Vision and how we could apply Computer Vision techniques on robotics to make progress on Artificial General Intelligence. I think this is pretty cool! However, I am yet to explore more domain specific ML in my second year and hopefully I can determine my focus in the near future!\"\n",
