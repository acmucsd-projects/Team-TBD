    - We needed to find a dataset which suited our goals the best for predicting MBTI personalities and we opted for this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/mbti-type/data).
    - :orange[We assigned each of the 16 MBTI personality types a number from 0 - 15] to so that we could identify which personality was being predicted. In order to start training the model, we needed to do some data preprocessing steps. We removed all the special characters and numbers along with links. We only kept the words that were inside the allowed range of 3 - 30 characters. We then used the pretrained BERT tokenizer in order to tokenize the posts in the dataset.
